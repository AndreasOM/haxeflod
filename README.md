haxeflod
========

Haxe "port" of the FLOD (flash-mod) player.

Actually this is just a small converter script that generates a .swf-library that you can link
and some .hx-headers.

Let's go:

	git clone git@github.com:AndreasOM/haxeflod.git
	cd haxeflod
	./convert.sh
	./test.sh
	
And you should be ready to go.

Note:
This are best case scripts without error checking
and only serve as a reference.
